# Cell-type-specific-predictive-model
Cell-type-specific predictive model for prioritizing disease-associated genes and gene sets

The codes were used for the analyses of single-nucleus gene expression data of ASD and controls for identifying cell type-specific ASD-associated genes and gene sets.
The analyzed single-nucleus gene expression data was deposited at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4319508
